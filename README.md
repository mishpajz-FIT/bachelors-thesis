#### Abstract

This bachelor's thesis focuses on the design and development of a web application for 3D online configuration of modular products. The thesis examines comparable existing applications and implements a product-agnostic, front-end-only, customizable web configurator conceived for use by small businesses. The configurator provides a straightforward definition of configurable products and operates solely using a web server. The implementation leverages modern technologies, combining Three.js with React. The thesis furthermore describes an example deployment of the created solution in a real-world scenario and discusses the business aspects of the application. The result of this bachelor's thesis is a tool businesses can use to introduce modular product configuration on their websites.
