  abstract = {We assert that the New Economy, together with the advent of electronic commerce, has moved mass customization beyond the realm of myth and mystery for many firms and squarely into the realm of mandatory consideration. The shift away from mass marketing and toward mass customization parallels a similar shift away from mass communication (broad-casting) toward targeted communication (direct addressing). We observe that this phenomenon has enabled a new wave of customer intimacy. Firms are responding by fundamentally changing their manufacturing, distribution, and delivery of products to enable economical mass production of customized goods. The full implications of this apparent paradigm shift remain unpredictable. We posit that this shift offers the global society the potential of profound benefits as well as the risk of substantial cost.},

  abstract = {The primary argument in favour of mass customization is the delivery of superior customer value. Using willingness-to-pay (WTP) measurements, Franke and Piller (2004), Journal of Product Innovation Management, 21, 401–415 have recently shown that customers designing their own watches with design toolkits are willing to pay premiums of more than 100\% (ΔWTP). In the course of three studies, we found that this type of value increment is not a singular occurrence but might rather be a general phenomenon, as we again found average ΔWTPs of more than 100\% among customers designing their own cell phone covers, T-shirts and scarves. Building on this, we discuss the sources of benefits that are likely to explain this tremendous value increment. We argue that compared to conventional standard products, a mass-customized product might render the following utilitarian and hedonic benefits: (1) First, the output might be beneficial as self-designed products offer a much closer fit between individual needs and product characteristics. In addition to this mere functional benefit, extra value might also stem from (2) the perceived uniqueness of the self-designed product. As the customer takes on the role of an active co-designer, there may also be two general ‘do-it-yourself effects’: (3) First, the process of designing per se is likely to allow the customer to meet hedonic or experiential needs (process benefit). (4) Customers may also be likely to value the output of self-design more highly if they take pride in having created something on their own (instead of traditionally buying something created by somebody else). This is referred to as the ‘pride of authorship’ effect. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {This study analyzes which factors prompt customers to attribute value to products they design themselves using mass-customization (MC) toolkits. The assumption that self-design delivers superior customer value is fundamental to the concept of MC toolkits and can be found in almost any conceptual work in this field. However, spectacular failures reinforce the practical relevance of developing a deeper understanding of why and when MC toolkits generate value for customers—and when they do not. Research to date has assumed that the closer fit between the self-designed product's characteristics and the preferences of the customer is the dominant source of value. In this research, it is asked whether the enjoyment and perceived effort of the self-design process have an additional impact on the perceived value of self-designed products. This question is interesting because one could argue that a rational actor would hardly be willing to pay ex post for an economic good already consumed. The hypotheses are tested on 186 participants designing their own scarves with an MC toolkit. After completing the process, they submitted binding bids for “their” products in Vickrey auctions. Therefore, real buying behavior, not merely stated intentions, is observed. The present study finds that the subjective value of a self-designed product (i.e., one's bid in the course of the auction) is indeed impacted not only by the preference fit the customer expects it to deliver but also by (1) the process enjoyment the customer reports, (2) the interaction of preference fit and process enjoyment, and (3) the interaction of preference fit and perceived process effort. In addition to its main effect, preference fit can be interpreted as a moderator of the value-generating effect of process evaluation: in cases where the outcome of the process is perceived as positive (high preference fit), the customer also interprets process effort as a positive accomplishment, and this positive effect adds (further) value to the product. It appears that the perception of the self-design process as a good or bad experience is partly constructed on the basis of the outcome of the process. In the opposite case (low preference fit), effort creates a negative effect that further reduces the subjective value of the product. Likewise, process enjoyment is amplified by preference fit, although enjoyment also has a significant main effect, which means that regardless of the outcome, customers attribute higher value to a self-designed product if they enjoy the process. In a way, this effect resembles of the classic story of Tom Sawyer and the fence, in which Tom manages to “frame” the tedious chore of whitewashing a fence as a rare opportunity—thus persuading his friends to pay him for letting them work. Manufacturers designing an MC system therefore are advised to designing MC toolkits in a way that they elicit positive affective reactions that make their customers value their work.},

  abstract= {The idea of integrating users into the design and production process is a promising strategy for companies being forced to react to the growing individualization of demand. While there is a huge amount of managerial literature on mass customization, empirical findings are scarce. Our intensive literature review shows that specifically the core of a mass customization system, the toolkit and the users’ interaction with it, has hardly been researched. The objective of this paper is to set a research agenda in the field of user interaction with toolkits for mass customization. From the literature and 15 exploratory expert interviews with leading pioneering companies we deploy four key research issues in this evolving field.}

Compared with 2D graphic toolkits, 3D toolkit design requires better consideration of individual customer needs, consumer and toolkit interaction, and also a means of integrating with the underlying technical infrastructure. However, there is currently no widely accepted model or criteria to regulate and evaluate 3D MC toolkit design. Given these considerations, in this paper we provide an evaluation model for web-based 3D toolkits and a heuristic evaluation of two representative commercial web-based 3D toolkits. The evaluation results indicate the usefulness and effectiveness of the model as a scale for evaluating 3D toolkits. It also reveals that despite a fair amount of effort that has been devoted to theoretical research, current 3D toolkits are still at an early development stage. We therefore conclude this paper by identifying and encouraging further topics and questions as directions for future research.},

To fulfill the customers{\&}{\#}x2019; desires and requirements, it is not solely crucial to offer a customizable product but to also regard the entirety of the configuration process. Besides a strong technical fundament, therefore, a core success factor of configuration systems is providing an appropriate user interface that is easy to understand, allows intuitive handling, gives support in navigating through complex choice sets and guides users to the fitting solution. To provide customers with a positive configuration experience, a sound device-oriented interaction process understanding is necessary. The willingness to initiate emotional effects, offer an appropriate visualization, initiate emotional effects and reduce pain points like long loading times and complexity boosters that lead to confusion is essential for building up a sustainable and successful solution.},

SPAs resemble native applications in their behavior and development but they run inside a browser process as opposed to native applications, which run in their own process. In order to understand why SPA development is so trendy today, we need to understand the changes that happened in the web environment that led to today's SPAs.

Several techniques have been applied for requirements prioritization in a case study of the conventional commercial bank where the main problems of the communication management process have been formulated and illustrated by the fishbone diagram. The MoSCoW technique has been applied to identification of four requirement groups, whose impact on the results principally differ within the scope of the identified problems.
