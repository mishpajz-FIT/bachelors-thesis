Over the past few decades, the rise of online commerce has caused a shift in consumer expectations, resulting in an increased demand for customized products. This gives rise to the need to shift focus towards mass customization, where products are customized according to individual preferences. In order to thrive in this sector, companies must modify their product offerings to be able to meet the unique needs of users. This necessitates the existence of a system that enables customers to express their preferences and convert them into the product configurations. \cite{Fulkerson2000}

The introduction of customization has been shown to significantly improve the customer's perception of the value of the product. The involvement of consumers in the customization process leads to a stronger bond with the product, resulting in a perception of higher value compared to standard off-the-shelf products. This aspect of mass customization makes it an appealing and compelling strategy for businesses to implement. \cite{Schreier2006} However, when implementing such system, it is crucial to ensure that the customization process is pleasurable for the customer. Research has shown that the enjoyment experienced during the customization also affects the perceived value of the final product, highlighting the importance of good implementation. \cite{Franke2010}

The task of transforming user preferences into concrete designs is a difficult endeavor that can be further hindered by a lack of effective communication between the customer's explanation of their desires and the business's comprehension. The use of online product configurators seemingly provides a solution for this issue by offering a user-friendly and visually appealing platform, which allows customers to customize products to their specifications, improves customer experience by increasing engagement and interactivity, and helps to bridge the gap between customer expectations and the end product. These tools have become an integral part of successful personalization strategies. \cite{Franke2003}

The introduction of modern technologies such as WebGL or Augmented Reality (AR) has expanded the potential of online configurators. These advances enable these toolkits to become more powerful and visually illustrative tools that provide a higher level of interactivity and realism than what was previously accessible. \cite{Cozzi2015}

\section{Objective of this thesis}
%---------------------------------------------------------------

The primary objective of this thesis is to design and implement an application (toolkit) for online configuration of modular products. The toolkit aims to be product-agnostic, adaptable and customizable, usable by a range of businesses, enabling their customers to interactively customize their modular products. The focus is on ensuring that the toolkit is not only flexible in accommodating various specific needs, but also straightforward for businesses to maintain after deploying, emphasizing lightweight infrastructure requirements. 
To accomplish this main objective, this requires an analysis of the characteristics found in current product configurators, as well as an examination of comparable solutions currently available to businesses.

\section{Structure of this thesis}
%---------------------------------------------------------------

This thesis is divided into seven chapters. The initial chapter entails an examination of existing solutions and an investigation into the functionalities that should be incorporated into this particular application. The second chapter contains a discussion of the application's design, the technologies chosen, the architecture, and the data structures. The third chapter is devoted to implementation. Chapter four focuses on the deployment of the implemented application in a particular business as an example. In addition, it discusses the resulting changes in the business processes of the selected business. In the sixth chapter, the tests used in the development of the application are described. Finally, the last chapter summarizes the achieved results and suggests possible directions of future development.

At present, numerous companies are incorporating product configurators into their sales strategies in various industries, including automotive, fashion, furniture, housing, and more. These configurators serve as either the main or supplementary selling tool for these businesses.

The Configurator Database Project by cyLEDGE MEDIA aims to catalog these web-based configuration tools. In the 2017/2018 report, they tracked 1250 deployments of these tools, but the actual number will be much greater, as the database contains only the most commonly used solutions. \cite{cyLEDGE2018}
